Chapter two

The outcome

Dr McGonzalex led him to  what looked like a normal indoor basketball court but then when Dr McGonzalex flicked the lights off everything became dark and filled with lasers. A minute later Ren saw five other figures come, three of which joined Ren whilst the others were talking instinctively among themselves. Dr McGonzalex explained the rules to them and told them that  this course was called the Theodore Brake course. After that, they got paired up with other people, Ren got paired up with a boy named Yangmo, he was eleven years old. They were tied back to back and had to get through the lasers without any types of communication. It looked easy but it wasn’t at all because the lasers ahead had a pattern almost too complicated to figure out but Ren knew there always had a pattern. So he studied from where the lasers were coming from and that gave him the answer on how to get through the field of lasers. They were given two minutes of talking time. Ren told Yangmo in a whisper that they needed to go in a zig-zag then to jump on every three seconds and crawl the rest of the way. Ren and Yangmo were the pair that got through without  touching a single laser or tripping over themselves.

When Ren got back from the Theodore Brake Course Ren and Yangmo were told to meet Axl back at the first hallway second door to the right. Both Ren and Yangmo had confused faces as they walked from their rooms. On the way Yangmo asked Ren how he had figured it out Ren replied quietly but clearly “ I navigated the lasers from the sides and corners of the room”. After an awkward silence Yangmo said “You can call me Mo if you want, because it literally means ink in chinese”, a while later they found the door and Ren pushed it open, Axl welcomed them in sitting behind his desk and told them to sit down in the seats in front him as they sat down Axl said “I would not have expected two people tied together back to back to be able to get through the Theodore Brake Course without tripping over once” “So tell me how did you get through the course?” Ren replied quietly saying the exact same phrase as he said to Mo. “You two will stay here for the night so I presume you will need rooms to stay in, you won’t mind if you share a room do you?” Axl added “Sure we don’t mind” they both said. A while later Ren and Yangmo were shown to their room Ren barely paid any attention to where they were going; it had a bunk bed and two desks and all their stuff sent from the hotel. “Can I have the top?” asked Ren “Sure,” replied Mo. When Ren was climbing to the top he was running the conversation with Dr Grate back in his mind when he noticed something. He asked Mo “Was there traffic today?” “No, why” replied Mo “ Because Dr Grate said there was”

 “Who?” 

“The person that explained everything to me, she said the traffic was bad, but there was hardly any cars today”

	As they slept Ren dreamt of being a manager at a preschool with kids screaming, crying and hitting each other. In the morning Ren was told to take Mo down to Dr Grate’s office as they proceeded down the hallways they saw someone whispering to another person and then the other set of in a run, Mo caught Ren’s eye and set of in a sprint following that person they got to a red door and saw the person typing in a passcode so they decided to wait and watch. Unfortunately Dr Grate spotted them so Ren made up an excuse so they could get out of trouble as they were about to go Dr Grate added “Axl wants to see you Ren ''. Ren made his way back to Axl’s office alone as Mo got led away to Dr Grate’s Office. In the office Ren waited for Axl to come back during the time he was waiting Ren looked around at his belongings, a round circular room with a brown cabinet and oak wood desk. A minute later Axl came walking in expressionless as usual,  with a clipboard in his hand he spoke to Ren with no emotion “As you may not know we think you did exceptionally well in the Theodore Brake Course and we have decided that you do not need any more tests at the moment.” Ren was not surprised by the fact he had passed and did not need more tests.
