The next week Ren and Mo were getting ready for their mission packing and practicing their cover stories.

They were told that they would be staying at Saxon Hotel and confirmed that they would be working at Jade Melrose Arch. Axl bought plane tickets for both of them and had told them to stay safe and stay together. The plane ride had been eleven hours and thirteen minutes with a forty-two minute drive to Saxon Hotel. The driver handed each of them an envelope. Inside there was a letter:

Dear Ren 

Your work shift starts at 8 am sharp. For your first day someone will show you around and show how to operate the machines just in case something happens. Meet me in my office.

I hope you have had a good time already.

Sincerely, Brandy Youpis

“Well that sounded promising” said Mo “I guess” Ren replied.              

                                                             \*

The two were greeted with “You’re late\!” as they entered the room. “I’ve sent Zuri and Imani off to find you two, well i’ll just tell them to come back”.  As he said that he turned around. Mo and Ren assumed that this was Brandy. Now that Brandy had turned around they could get a good look, he was a muscular, athletic, businessman. He sighed although his face showed excitement, and Ren’s first impression was that he was planning something sinister and hadn’t had time to cram in some adjustments that morning, even though it sounded like an impossible scheme to conduct in secret. The way he smiled, with that glint in his eye, sent a warm unnerving chill down Ren’s spine. There was an air of confidence in his voice that hinted at a troubling intent, so Ren didn’t rule the option out. The day went by normally Zuri and Imani showed them around
