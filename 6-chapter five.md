Mission

The next week Ren and Mo were getting ready for their mission packing and practicing their cover stories.

They were told that they would be staying at Saxon Hotel and confirmed that they would be working at Jade Melrose Arch. Axl bought plane tickets for both of them and had told them to stay safe and stay together. The plane ride had been eleven hours and thirteen minutes with a forty-two minute drive to Saxon Hotel. The driver handed each of them an envelope. Inside there was a letter:

Dear Ren 

Your work shift starts at 8 am sharp. For your first day someone will show you around and show how to operate the machines just in case something happens. Meet me in my office.

I hope you have had a good time already.

Sincerely, Brandy Youpis

“Well that sounded promising” said Mo “I guess” Ren replied.              

                                                             \*

The next morning the two boys woke up at six in the morning preparing for the mission and “work” at the jewelry store. Breakfast was french toast and chocolate milk. Quarter to eight Ren and Yangmo left for a fifteen minute drive to Jade Melrose Arch for work.

	As soon as they arrived the work began, starting with an “adventure”, because they needed to find Brandy’s office. When Mo and Ren finally found it, they were already six minutes late. The two were greeted with “You’re late\!” as they entered the room. “I’ve sent Zuri and Imani off to find you two, well i’ll just tell them to come back”
