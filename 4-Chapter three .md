Behind the door

Ren found Mo in their room and decided that they would try to find out what was behind the red door that night. So at one in the morning they crept out of bed and found their way back to the red door efficiently and Mo put in the code which was seven, nine, four, six. Just when they opened the door, two packs of bears, Mo fought one pack and Ren fought the other. When they were finished two full grown men attacked them but Mo and Ren tied them up. They were keen to get out, just when Ren closed the door behind them quickly then Axl jumped out and announced “Well done you passed your final test”.

That morning Ren made his way back to Axl’s office a third time while Mo went to Dr Grate’s office and with their fingers crossed, wishing each other good luck they separated like peeling off as if somebody was peeling a banana. In Axl’s office Axl was sitting there waiting for him to come in and as Ren opened the door he signaled for Ren to sit down in one of the unoccupied seats. “You have certainly broken one of the rules but as we are spies, sometimes we do have to step out of the line-” Axl stopped talking abruptly as someone knocked on the door. Ren stood up to open the door but as soon as he was about to open the door opened itself.

                                                             \*

	Dr Grate and Mo appeared behind the door “ I think we’ve got ourselves a problem”.
